# 8Ball Pool

A 2-Player 8Ball Pool game coded in Processing.

Use the mouse to aim and click and drag to adjust velocity.

To win, pot all of the balls of your type and then the eight ball.

If you don't hit a ball of your type it is a foul.

If you don't hit the 8 ball in last, you lose.

Use a lower velocity for better accuracy.
